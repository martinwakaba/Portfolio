      <h2 className="about-title">About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a full-stack developer driven by a passion for building impactful web applications. My skill set covers a diverse range of technologies, from using Figma for design, to React and Three.js for interactive front-end experiences, and Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Flask for dependable back-end development. With proficiency in Linux, I’m able to manage deployments and system tasks effectively.

          <br />
          <br />My tech journey started out of a curiosity to understand how things work, and it has since grown into a rewarding career of continuous learning and innovation. I find great satisfaction in collaborating on projects and tackling challenging problems to create meaningful solutions. Beyond work, I stay inspired by playing football and drawing, both of which help me stay energized and grounded.</p>
